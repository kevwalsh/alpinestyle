It's been a busy summer as always and I'm getting behind on updating this blog.  About six weeks ago, the video <a href="http://vimeo.com/70149174">Spirits of Asgard</a> was released, and has been very well received.  It's been posted to Outside Television, as well as received a Vimeo Staff pick, so it's recieved a lot of views, which is pretty cool!  A huge congratulations to <a href="http://joshualavigne.com/">Joshua Lavigne</a> for producing it.  Check his website for more photos of the trip as well as the July / August 2013 issue of Gripped which features some pics and a 2500 word story I wrote about it.  Josh's words and images are also shared in the 2013 Canadian Alpine Journal.  Although the video covers the &quot;darker&quot; aspects of our trip, such as a couple of close calls we had, it was very a fun and successful trip.  Some photos and stories have been shared here on a blog post from last August, but I thought I'd take a few a minutes to share a few more images as I link the the video here, as an attempt to share a greater visual tour of the amazing landscape Baffin has to offer.

<span>On
the morning of July 17<sup>th</sup>, Joshua Lavigne, Ines Papert and I, got off
the plane in Pangnirtung, Baffin Island.  Three hours later we were
cruising past the icebergs on the Fiord, propelled by the twin outboard motors
on the back of our outfitters fishing boat.  We soon said our goodbyes,
arranged a pick up date, and began the trek up the Weasel Valley into Auyuittuq
National Park. </span>
</p>
<p class="ecxmsonormal" style="margin: 0.1pt 0cm">
<span> </span>
</p>
<p class="ecxmsonormal" style="margin: 0.1pt 0cm">
<span>After
three days of rugged approaching, frigid creek crossings, and tantalizing
vistas of the valley’s huge granite walls, we arrived at base camp on the
Turner Glacier, directly below the North Face of Mt. Asgard.  Another big
day was spent returning to the valley bottom to retrieve a cache of supplies
and equipment that had been placed in the winter by snowmobile, which was
followed a much needed rest day.  More rest would have been nice, but a
second sleep-in would have to do. Great weather had us setting out up the
nearby south buttress of Mt. Loki, the second most beautiful peak in our
vicinity.  A continuous crack system from glacier to summit enticed us,
and we climbed it in thirteen 60-meter pitches.  Old rappel stations were
encountered the whole way.  We suspect we repeated the only route described
in the guidebook, put up by Kiwi climbers some 20 years earlier.  It was
likely the second ascent, first free ascent, and was very similar in quality
and length to the Bugaboos ultra classic Becky Chouinard.  If this route
had been in the Bugs, it would see daily line-ups!  </span>
</p>
<p class="ecxmsonormal" style="margin: 0.1pt 0cm">
<span> </span>
</p>
<p class="ecxmsonormal" style="margin: 0.1pt 0cm">
<span>After
another rest day we committed to our main objective, the 1200-meter unclimbed
north face of Mt. Asgard’s south tower, with three days of food, fuel, and good
weather forecasted.  We started right at the toe of the NW prow and were
soon making good progress, leading in blocks of three to five pitches. 
One seconder would usually follow on ascenders, while other would climb the
pitch, except on easier or traversing pitches where both climbers would
climb.  After 12 pitches, we ditched our bags on a big ledge and began
exploring options.  Two and half traverse pitches were climbed towards the
west face, where we were hoping to find access to a spectacular system of
corners and face cracks, but to no avail.  After reversing the traverse and
deciding to bivi on the nice ledge sheltered by an overhanging corner, two
pitches of difficult wide cracks were climbed, and 75-meters of rope were fixed
to speed things up the next day.</span>
</p>
<p class="ecxmsonormal" style="margin: 0.1pt 0cm">
<span> </span>
</p>
<p class="ecxmsonormal" style="margin: 0.1pt 0cm">
<span>With
two sleeping bags zipped together and three people inside, it was one of the
warmest bivis on a ledge any of us had ever experienced! The next day, we
ascended our lines and continued to the top, eventually wrapping around to the
west face.  Here we found by far the best climbing of the trip. 
Although the stone quality had been excellent the whole way, it seemed to get
better the higher we got.  150-meters from the top, dark clouds swept over
from the south, and it soon began to lightly rain or snow.  At 11 p.m., we
all stood on the summit, shrouded by thick fog that limited the visibility to a
mere 30-meters.  </span>
</p>
<p class="ecxmsonormal" style="margin: 0.1pt 0cm">
<span> </span>
</p>
<p class="ecxmsonormal" style="margin: 0.1pt 0cm">
<span>Despite
the poor visibility but with previous knowledge of the descent from a few years
back, we decided to begin the rappels down the normal descent route of the
smaller south side of the mountain, hoping to escape the exposure of the summit
before the conditions worsened. The wind was gusting hard as the storm
intensified, and it was the darkest park of the arctic night, yet we hadn’t
anticipated the crux to be on the relatively easy / straightforward decent. </span>
</p>
<p class="ecxmsonormal" style="margin: 0.1pt 0cm">
<span> </span>
</p>
<p class="ecxmsonormal" style="margin: 0.1pt 0cm">
<span>The
technical rappelling, interspersed with loose slippery down climbing went by
slowly but surely.  We were making good progress, but already cold and wet
before it started raining and eventually snowing in the early hours of the
following day.  With only 300 meters of 4<sup>th</sup> class slab
scrambling to go to reach the glacier we had no option but to huddle under the
8x10 foot tarp we carried until conditions improved.  Finally, after about
six long hours of shivering, the sun came out and warmed us just enough to
continue safely to the glacier, where we were able to eat, drink, and recharge
for the hike back around the mountain to base camp. </span>
</p>
<p class="ecxmsonormal" style="margin: 0.1pt 0cm">
<span> </span>
</p>
<p class="ecxmsonormal" style="margin: 0.1pt 0cm">
<span>All
29-pitches of our route were free climbed, on-sight, except for a five-meter
section of icy squeeze chimney with verglassed walls.  Had it been dry, it
would have been a straightforward bit of 5.10.  It was the only aid on the
route save for one wet move on the final pitch.  Technically, the hardest
climbing had been 5.11+, which was certainly easier than we had expected, and
the route would be a good candidate for one-day, all-free attempt, for a
two-person team.</span>
</p>
<p class="ecxmsonormal" style="margin: 0.1pt 0cm">
<span> </span>
</p>
<p class="ecxmsonormal" style="margin: 0.1pt 0cm">
<span>After
some rest we moved back down to the Weasel Valley, intent on spending our last
week on some other peaks we had eyed up on the way in.  However, the sad
news of my father losing his 8-year battle to MSA, a rare form of Parkinson’s
disease, reached us by satellite phone and put a quick end to any climbing
thoughts.  The new task for me was to make it to his funeral in just three
days.  A three-day hike had to be made in one huge day, and then flights
needed to be changed.  So with heavy packs, and heavier hearts, a
difficult and rainy trek began back to civilization began.  Joshua and
Ines had no issues with accompanying me on this for which I was grateful. 
We considered ourselves lucky to have had the weather and conditions at the
start of the trip, and all felt satisfied with what we had just
accomplished.  With the cold, low-pressure weather system that had just
settled in and that was also forecasted for the week ahead, it was perhaps just
as well to be leaving, this special and spectacular land.   </span>

It's been a while since I've posted here mainly because life has been crazy busy, with work, family, skiing and climbing, a slideshow for the Calgary Mountain Club, writing an article for Gripped Magazine which just came out, training hard, and organizing an expedition to Baffin Island.  Currently, I'm actually bivouacking in the Ottawa airport, halfway through four flights to Baffin, where a little ski adventure will start in about 24 hours from now(more about that shortly).   So, I thought I'd take a few minutes to quickly recap the last three months.  Living in Calgary this winter has been a little different than what I'm used to after 20 years based in B.C. ski towns.  There's a lot of traffic, concrete, wealth and opulence, and no real mountains anywhere within about 100 kms.  Although I feel distant  from my tribe of mountain freaks, and somewhat ski deprived (I can't blow mornings off work anymore to shred the fresh powder), there still have been lots of quality outings, and many miles on the highway getting to and from the mountains.  I have to admit I've felt a little bit caged to say the least, but this trip should help sooth the soul, as getting back to nature typically does.  That said, the city isn't all that bad and I'm taking advantage of new opportunities to train, heal old injuries, and experience some new opportunities.  It's been a good place to organize a big trip from too...<br />
<br />
January and February were particularly good for deep powder skiing around Kicking Horse and Rogers Pass, and I logged a reasonable amount of days where face shots were plentiful on just about every turn.  It's been an exceptional snow year!  As usual, I also gave in to the pull of the Stanley Headwall on several occasions for ice climbing adventures, and also as usual, the headwall remains incredibly inspiring, even after dozens of days there!  March on the other hand has been challenging.  Lots of extreme avalanche danger combined with bad weather on my days off have kept any big plans from getting off the ground.  I've still managed a few good sessions of ice and mixed climbing, and have dedicated a lot of time to rehabbing old injuries, training in the climbing gym, and cross training in the weight gym.  I think all of this is paying off as I'm starting to feel pretty in shape, as the balance is slowly starting to come back, and I'm psyches to continue the program for a good while.  I can hardly wait to test out its effectiveness while testing my limits in the arctic!  <br />

Chris brazeau near the sumit of Mt. Asgard, Baffin Island on our 2009 trip.  The couloirs, peaks and snow faces seen in the background provided the inspiration for the trip I'm currently on.  Every summit we stood on had revealed incredible ski potential. 
</p>
<p>
More about the Baffin trip:<br />
In 2009 I spent a month climbing in Auyuittuq National Park.  One of the things that really blew my partner Chris Brazeau and I away were the abundance of steep ski lines, and the potential for interesting glacier circuits to connect them all.  Looking back at the photos with topographical maps in hand, it soon became clear that this trip needed to be bumped to the top of the list.  Finally it's actually happening!  <br />
<br />
My partners this time are Conor Hurley and Claire Seiber of Revelstoke.  The plan is to have the Inuit outfitters that we've hired, tow us 70 kms by snowmobile to Summit Lake, where we'll commence the journey by skiing a loop around Mt. Asgard, and then back south towards Pangnirtung via a circuitous network of glaciers.  The goals are to ski some of the most inspiring couloirs and peaks that we see (we have quite a few in mind already); explore some rarely seen sections of the park, to document the journey through video and photography; to survive without succumbing to injury, frostbite, or getting eaten by polar bears.    <br />
<br />
Some of the challenges we expect to deal with include crevassed glaciers; whiteout navigation; difficult snow conditions which include everything from avalanche prone slopes to potentially icy conditions; intense wind / wind chill; arctic temperatures; melting all of our water / cooking in cold conditions; towing heavy sleds with all of our food and gear; possibilities of encountering a polar bears; preserving and recharging our camera batteries; having enough energy left over to ski tour about 100 km and hopefully have enough energy and drive ski somewhere between 6-8 epic runs! <br />
<br />
There are so many variables and unknowns on this one, that there is no doubt, Claire, Conor and I are about to experience one of the adventures of our lifetime!<br />
<br />
As we'll be entirely self sufficient and winter camping above the Arctic Circle, it's a very gear intensive trip.  We have lots of warm gear, extra camera batteries, dehydrated food, and hopefully everything we need to survive.  I'll write a much more detailed gear list, food and gear review, a trip report with photos, soon after I'm back, or maybe even on the way back.  <br />
<br />
A huge thank you to all of the trips sponsors who have helped make this all possible:  Arcteryx, Scarpa, Vega, G3, MEC, and Stoke Roasted Coffee!<br />
