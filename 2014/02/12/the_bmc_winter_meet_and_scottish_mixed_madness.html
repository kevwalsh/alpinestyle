<span style="font-family: Helvetica">I was fortunate enough to attend the 2014 BMC
Winter Meet this year, with my girlfriend Michelle Kadatz, where 47 foreign climbers
from 25 countries got together at the Glenmore Lodge in Aviemore during the
last week of January.<span>   </span>Every
day, each visitor gets paired up with a host climber from the UK, familiar with
the Scottish winter climbing scene, and together they head out on an adventure.<span>  </span>At the end of the day, everybody has
dinner and drinks together, and has the option to watch slideshows and
presentations at the lodge’s lecture theater.<span>  </span>Halfway through the week, a partner switch is made so the
visitor gets a total of two different hosts to climb with.<span>  </span></span>

an unusual amount of snow, a high avalanche hazard and generally bad
weather.<span>   </span>This however seemed
to force people to dig a little deeper, and as a result, there were a lot of
early starts made and an impressive list of climbs got done.<span>  </span></span>

<span style="font-family: Helvetica">My first partner was Nick Bullock, a veteran of
the Scottish winter scene, who had been putting up cutting edge first ascents
and generally raising the bar for well over a decade, both in Scotland and in
the greater ranges.<span>  </span>Like me, he
really liked to get after it.<span>  </span>But
in order to do just that, it seemed prudent to use our first day, a bad weather
day even by Scottish standards, to put a track into Craeg Meagaidh and try to
find the start of a route called Extasy, put up during the 2005 winter meet by
Bruno Sourzac and Dave Hesleden.<span>  
</span>It had been one Nick was stoked for since a friend of his made the only
repeat and spoke highly of its quality.<span> 
</span>That day we couldn’t see more than halfway up the 250m face, but with
the boot track in and the start of the route located, the cards seemed nicely stacked
in our favor. <span> </span>The hike was also a
good way to shake off my jetlag. <span> </span>We made the routes 3<sup>rd</sup> ascent the next day in a
17-hour car-to-car effort, and it didn’t disappoint.<span>  </span>The entire cliff was coated in thin ice and rime – prime
Scottish conditions, and the climbing was fiercely sustained!<span>  </span>Following the thickest, most supportive
ice or neve, usually just a couple of centimeters thick and often too thin to
hold body weight, we battled upwards for 5 long pitches.<span>  </span>It never felt like we had the route in
the bag until the very top.<span> 
</span>Protection was scarce, and head-spinning run-outs were the norm.<span>  A perfect intro!  </span></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica"><span></span>Nick stated on his blog:<span> </span></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica"><span> </span>“</span>Its difficult to imaging that I
will have a more compelling, engaging day of the winter than this
one. We climbed the route totally on ice but the ice was less than perfect
and the ground at times was steep. The gear to protect the climb was minimal
and the descent ‘interesting’… All in all, a pretty full-on day.”<span> </span>

<span style="font-family: Helvetica">The next day, the weather was the usual
slashing rain in the valley bottoms and winds up to 90 mph up high. This made
it easier to take a much needed rest day, as Extasy had taxed our bodies both
mentally and physically. <span> </span>The event
organizers initiated a partner switch that night, and I got paired with Greg
Boswell.<span>  </span>Greg is as bad-ass as
they come and has been turning heads both at home, and abroad, with lots of
difficult and serious new routes and repeats under his belt.<span>  </span>We immediately started making plans to
climb a new line he had scoped on the beautiful quartzite walls of Beinn Eighe.<span>  </span>But Nick’s new partner needed a rest
day so he insisted on making joining us too. <span> </span></span>

the base of the route.<span>  </span>Greg won
the first rock paper scissors and fired a series of roofs above a snow ledge
near the top of the West-central Gully.<span> 
</span>Much to Nick’s dismay I won the second rock paper scissors and scored
the second pitch - a long slightly overhanging off-width with a thin coating of
verglas.<span>  </span>Fortunately the rock had
just enough other features, and it turned out to be one of the best pitches I
climbed during the trip.<span>  </span>Nick
fired the final crack / corner system and we were soon treated to amazing
sunset over a stunning view of the north-western highlands.<span>  </span>“Lochs” dotted the green valleys
everywhere and the snowline at mid height gave the mountains a bigger feel,

Nick wrote on his blog: “The perfect day. Stunning settled
weather, a magnificent situation and a line both Greg and I had spotted a few
years back. I lost Scissor, paper, stone all-day and climbed the third
pitch, which was still good but not as spectacular as the second pitch or as
sustained as the first pitch. We called it Making the Cut after talking to
Simon Richardson about the amount of entries he has on his blog Scottish
Winter climbs.”

route on the same face, but after an hour of sitting in the car hoping for the
winds and rain to calm down, we opted for plan b.<span>  </span>This time it was Nick and I (Greg’s knee strain was acting
up, and he was getting off treatment) and Michelle and her partner Ian
Parnell.<span>  </span>Two days earlier they had
a big success on a 9-pitch Ben Nevis route called the Centurion one of the
longest in the area.<span>  </span>Another
nearby peak called Mael Gorm offered “the shortest approach in Scotland” which
by the time we got there made sense, especially with the gale force wind gusts.

as the first two climbs, it was a popular spot that day and many routes saw climbers
on them, and certainly way better than festering at the lodge.<span>  </span></span>

time since I’d seen so many really passionate mixed climbers getting after it
like that. For both myself and Michelle (who had amassed a route list most
locals were jealous of), there couldn’t have been a better introduction to winter
climbing in Scotland, and we’re deeply thankful to the BMC for organizing it,
our UK hosts – especially Nick, Greg, Will and Ian, and from the support we
received from the Alpine Club of Canada and Arcteryx for helping making it all

bucket list for a long time, and he was psyched to tag along to shoot some
climbing.<span>  </span>However, the weather
wasn’t panning out very well, and we got shut down a two days in a row, and not
for lack of trying.<span>  </span>At least we
managed to tour the countryside a bit and sample some of the finer local
vintages.<span>  </span>The folks that live in
the hills were incredibly hospitable and easy to get along with.<span>  </span>Finally we got some weather decent
enough for climbing, and we headed up the Number 3 gully on Ben Nevis, home to
some famous test-pieces I was hoping to try.<span>  </span>A thick fog on its upper reaches forced us to stay on lower
cliffs, and we climbed some obvious thin ice lines called Mega Route X, which
is classic, and a wild overhanging dagger line called Feeding Frenzy.<span>  </span>Late in the afternoon it cleared enough

for “a rare benign day” on Friday, which didn’t exactly pan out, as the fog

to be unclimbed, just left of Mick Fowler’s 7-pitch classic – The Shield
Direct.<span>  </span>After two-and-a-half
pitches of sustained overhanging dihedral action, laced with thin ice and neve,
we merged back with the shield and continued up it to the top of pitch-4.<span>  </span>The benign weather was abruptly ended

<span style="font-family: Helvetica">Scottish winter climbing is intense.<span>  </span>Every pitch was a memorable battle that
had me focused on nothing but the present.<span>  </span>The Highlands truly are the quintessential real deal venue
for mixed adventure. <span> </span>Rich with
history and virtually devoid of any in-situ gear, proper mixed climbing in its
purest form was a refreshing experience!<span> 
</span>The addictiveness of it grew on me throughout the trip, and I know it
won’t be long before I’m back again.</span>
