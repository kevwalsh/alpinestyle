msgid "Image Enhanced Scaling replaces the image scaling function used by the image module with one that gives a better image quality. This is achieved by applying a sharpness filter to the image derivatives and converting them to a suitable color profile."

msgid "Note: this module requires that the Imagemagick framework provided by the image module is installed and properly configured. This involves moving the file <em>image.imagemagick.inc</em> from the image module's directory to the <em>includes</em> directory. See README.txt for more details."
