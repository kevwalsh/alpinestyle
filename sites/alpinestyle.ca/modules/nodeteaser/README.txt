===============

This module provides a separate teaser field.
This provides three advantages to the standard teaser system:
1)	It allows users to specify a totally disctint teaser, like a
		summary or description, that does not contain any node text.
2)	TinyMCE attempts to encode the <!--break--> normally used for
		creating teasers.  This circumvents that problem.
3)	Users more familiar with Movable Type, Text Pattern, and the 
		like will be more comfortable with this interface.

  Click this to display a "continue reading POSTNAME" link 
  where the teaser ends.
  
Show Teaser on specific pages
	Designate on which pages you would like or would not like
	the separate teaser option to appear.  You probably don't need 
	this on pages, forum posting, or comments, for instance.
